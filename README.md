# ROSCO-DVXC-MERGE

Merge together series of AVI exports from Rosco dual-view dashcams to create a single video.

## Bash version

This runs in \*NIX/BSD environments requiring ffmpeg and mencoder.

## Go Version

This can run using the command line ffmpeg.exe and mencoder.exe binaries in Windows and the same requirements as the Bash version in other environments. More compatible, less hassle outside of the inital compile.
